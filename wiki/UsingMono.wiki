==What's working so far?==
 * Creating Torrents using MonoTorrent
 * Taking screenshots using MTN

==What's not working so far?==
 * MediaInfo

= Getting Started = 
 * Download Mono Framework from http://www.go-mono.com/mono-downloads/download.html

== TDMaker ==
 * Download http://tdmaker.googlecode.com/files/TDMaker-1.8.10-ubuntu-bin.zip
 * Extract it to somewhere like: 
{{{
~\Applications\TDMaker
}}}

== !MediaInfo ==
 * Download appropriate MediaInfo libmediainfo0 and its dependencies from http://mediainfo.sourceforge.net/en/Download
  * for Ubuntu:
   # http://downloads.sourceforge.net/zenlib/libzen0_0.3.5-1_i386.Debian_Etch.deb
   # http://downloads.sourceforge.net/mediainfo/libmediainfo0_0.7.8-1_i386.Debian_Etch.deb

== Setting up TDMaker.exe.config==
To map MediaInfo.dll to the relevant Linux library, you need to create a TDMaker.exe.config file and have the following. The following file needs to be in the same directory TDMaker.exe is in. 
{{{
    <configuration>
            <dllmap dll="MediaInfo.dll" target="libmediainfo.so.0"/>
    </configuration>
}}}

== Running TDMaker in Mono Terminal==
Execute TDMaker: 
{{{
mono --debug TDMaker.exe
}}}

== Troubleshooting ==
 * If mtn does not execute properly then in Terminal, try:
{{{
chmod +x mtn
}}}
 * If you get the following error: 
{{{
** (TDMaker.exe:29543): WARNING **: The following assembly referenced from /home/ajt/Downloads/TDMAKER/TDMaker.exe could not be loaded:

try installing *libmono-winforms2.0-cil*
