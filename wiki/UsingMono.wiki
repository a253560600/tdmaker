==What's working so far?==
 * Creating Torrents

==What's not working so far?==
 * MediaInfo
 * Taking screenshots

= Getting Started = 
 * Download Mono Framework from http://www.go-mono.com/mono-downloads/download.html
 * Have yourself all the files typically in C:\Program Files\TDMaker
 * Execute TDMaker: 
{{{
mono --debug TDMaker.exe
}}}

To map MediaInfo.dll to the relevant Linux library, you need to create a TDMaker.exe.config file and have the following:

== TDMaker.exe.config==
{{{
    <configuration>
            <dllmap dll="MediaInfo.dll" target="libmediainfo.so.0"/>
    </configuration>
}}}
